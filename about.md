I am in the process of transitioning into another career after 14 years as a lawyer.  CodeOregon and [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) have provided the training I need to make the transition.  You can see my Treehouse profile [here](http://teamtreehouse.com/theodoresumner).  My sites, particularly [Pack 198](http://vetsrights.com), will continue to evolve as I improve my skills with more Treehouse training.

I have developed full stack skills, particularly in PHP, HTML, CSS (preferrably using Sass and Compass), and JavaScript.  I have taken courses in agile development with an emphasis on Scrum, design principles such as color theory and layout techniques, SEO, UX, brand identity, and databases.  My [Treehouse profile](http://teamtreehouse.com/theodoresummer) has a current listing of over 185 separate achievements.  

My primary project is a page for Cub Scout Pack 198.  It was build based on a site used to teach PHP concepts at Treehouse.  I am going to refactor the site using Slim and Twig.  I also will add user log-in and have the ability to upload photos for all the parents.  The log-in will create a roster and there will be a way to email all the parents in certain defined subgroups.

I find the back-end development interesting and plan on taking the Python, Ruby, and Rails courses from Treehouse as well.
