I am in the process of transitioning into another career after 14 years as a lawyer.  CodeOregon and [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) have provided the training I need to make the transition.  You can see my Treehouse profile [here](http://teamtreehouse.com/theodoresumner).  My sites, particularly [Pack 198](http://vetsrights.com), will continue to evolve as I improve my skills with more Treehouse training.

This site is designed to provide links to sites I have designed with some background information about how they were build.
