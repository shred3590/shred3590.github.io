I have been learning exciting information at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).  Most recently I learned about Slim, a very light framework.  It is installed through composer and I will be using Twig to simplify the PHP and create a template for the site.  It is a really nice addition to coding PHP and I look forward gaining full understanding of its power through refactoring the site and adding addional features once the refactoring is complete.  I will write about my progress throughout the project.
