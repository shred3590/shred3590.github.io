title: "Pack 198"
---

I developed a web site for Cub Scout Pack 198 in Portland, Oregon.  It was built using PHP and Sass with Compass.  I utilized modern CSS such as flex boxes and gradients to create a modern, mobile first site.

I plan to integrate user registration for parents of scouts, photo and video upload by registered users, and a roster that is built from the registration information.

The site be placed on the pack's domain once we have access to it.
