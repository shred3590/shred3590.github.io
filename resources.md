These are some of my favorite programming sites.

There is a great [compilation of cheat sheets here](http://overapi.com) that is one of my go to locations for quick syntax reminders.  The online version links to the documentation for each command as well.

[PHP Official Documentation](http://php.net) - This is the official documentation.  No more needs to be said.

[Composer's Home Page](https://getcomposer.org) - Composer is a great tool for helping build sites and is how to use Slim, Twig, and Redbean.  Easily add PHPMail, Swiftmail, and other packages with Composer.

[Packagist](https://packagist.org) - Lists the packages available through Composer.

[Slim micro framework](http://www.slimframework.com) - A miro framework that I am experimenting with.

[Twig template engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) - a templating engine that works well with Slim.

[Redbean](http://redbean.com) - An ORM for database use.  I am just exploring this to see how it works.  Slim, Twig, and Redbean can be installed at one time with redslim/redslim.
